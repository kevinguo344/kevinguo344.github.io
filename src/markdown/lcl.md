### Life Changing Labs


I worked at Life Changing Labsâ€™ Summer Incubator Program where I did design work for a few startups and LCL itself. Because of the nature of these startups, some of my work was placed under a non-disclosure agreement. However I can show some of my work for LCL specifically. Included in that work was promotional material for the cancelled Innovators Fair, an event for startups, student organizations, and individuals to display their ideas. A pitch competition for $3000 was supposed to occur at the end of the Fair.
