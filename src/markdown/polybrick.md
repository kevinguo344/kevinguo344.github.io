For Spring 2019, I am taking [Prof. Jenny Sabin\'s](http://www.jennysabin.com/) research seminar in Matter Design Computation. As part of the seminar, I will be working on the next version of Polybrick, a project in Prof. Sabin\'s lab. 

### Background

[Polybrick](http://www.jennysabin.com/polybrick/) has already gone through one version  

This page will get updated as work on Polybrick progresses throughout the semester.
