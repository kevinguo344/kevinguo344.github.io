### Polybrick
###### February 2019 - Present

For Spring 2019, I am taking [Prof. Jenny Sabin\'s](http://www.jennysabin.com/) research seminar in Matter Design Computation. As part of the seminar, I will be working on the next version of Polybrick, a project in Prof. Sabin\'s lab. 

### Background

[Polybrick](http://www.jennysabin.com/polybrick/) has already gone through one version previously. This new version of Polybrick is inspired by the microstructures that exists inside bone, with the goal of creating a material that is strong, materially efficient, and has properties not found in regular brick or other existing material. My role will focus on the robotic fabrication aspect of the project, using the Sulla robotic arm and other technologies to explore how to build Polybrick structures.

This page will get updated as work on Polybrick progresses throughout the semester.
