I want to build civic machines

The architectural robotics field is split into two camps, fabrication and interaction. The fabrication side is focused on building forms or methods using robots, typically large complex robot arms usually found in 

The prime example of an uncivic machine is the car: the better it does its job, the faster it can travel, the more comfortable it makes the driver, the safer it is, the more likely a driver will use it, the more likely they are going to get into an accident, the greater the traffic it creates, the more resources it consumes, the worse off society becomes. A civic machine does the opposite; while it can do its designated task well, it will be consciencious enough of its environment and its effect on people to know when to slow down or stop doing its designated task. A civic machine's understanding of civics lies in a self-awareness of its role and purpose rather than what it does in isolation.

Society has done more to exclude and segregate

Decisions about common spaces have long been defined by public policy, whether it be by redlining, by exclusionary zoning,

Increasingly, decisions about common space have been wielded by those with power: institutions, corporations, the wealthy. Even the supposedly democratic forums of local councils and city governance have been monopolized by the most privileged of entitled of property owners. These forces have blocked the creation of inclusive common spaces, whether by installing hostile benches, blocking high-density housing, arguing against mass transit, or many more examples of extreme abuses of the democratic processes, all in the name of keeping out "the wrong kinds of people." This is not only antithetical to the ideals of liberal democracy, it also portends a cycle of isolation, stagnation, and decay. 

I learned many lessons from my time at Ori. Mechanical elegance will almost always beat out computational complexity. There is no right way to approach aesthetics. Yet as we attempted to make the small apartment more usable and more livable, I realized that all the units that I helped install were at the 

The optimal smart-city machine will be like the ant. By itself, it'll be nothing special: its senses will be limited to a few basic inputs, its actions relatively predictable, its mechanisms simple and easy to grasp. But when put with another one of itself, or two of itself, or a legion of itself, it will be capable of immense mass action, building and moving on scales much larger than a single one.
