This was as an independent project I started after becoming fed up with the CUEMS’ outdated website, logo, and overall lack of brand direction. What began as a small project to change the squad’s logo spun into a larger project to change CUEMS’ public image. I updated logo design to better reflect CUEMS’ intended public image, build a new website, newly designed ID badge, and a new consistent set of branding material.
