### OcularMD

OcularMD started as a company for Cornell’s 3 Day Startup program where students found a startups, and present a final pitch in 3 days over one weekend. OcularMD was an app that could quickly diagnose diabetic retinopathy, a potentially blinding eye disease. Unlike previous works, I had to start completely from scratch, and I was able to make a corporate identity that was distinct and identifiable. OcularMD ended up wining 3 Day Startups\’ Big Red Venture Fund Seed Money Award, beating out four other startups founded at the same time.
